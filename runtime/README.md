# jankscripten runtime system

We have configured this crate to build a WebAssembly library and run tests
using WebAssembly and Node.

To build and run, you need to install the following dependencies (duplicated
from the main README):

```
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli
```
