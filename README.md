# Introduction

`jankscripten` is a compiler and runtime system that targets WebAssembly
and supports multiple front-end languages:

  - JankyScript is a language with JavaScript syntax. It supports
    higher-order functions and a standard library that is similar to
    JavaScript. The compiler translates JankyScript to
    <span class="smallcaps">NotWasm</span> by performing type inference
    and closure conversion.

  - <span class="smallcaps">NotWasm</span> is an explicitly-typed
    lower-level language that does not support higher-order functions.
    However, it does support:
    
      - Garbage collection: at the moment, a simple mark-and-sweep
        collector with a stop-and-copy region for floating point
        numbers.
    
      - String values: Worth mentioning, since WebAssembly does not
        support strings natively.
    
      - Any-typed values (a.k.a. type dynamic): a failed downcast
        crashes the program with an unrecoverable error (i.e., a
        WebAssembly trap).
    
      - Monotonic dynamic objects with prototype inheritance: The fields
        of these objects are of type Any, and new fields may be added
        dynamically. However, these objects *do not support field
        deletion*. Field lookup in dynamic objects is optimized using
        inline caching.
    
      - Hash tables and arrays: these store Any-typed values.
    
      - Explicit closures: Although
        <span class="smallcaps">NotWasm</span> does not support
        higher-order functions, it has a representation for closures
        (i.e., code + environment pointer) which is designed to fit into
        Any-typed values.
    
      - ML-style mutable references

JankyScript is *not JavaScript*. It makes several simplifying
assumptions, which it inherits from
<span class="smallcaps">NotWasm</span>. However, as long as you’re
working with “sane” JavaScript, e.g., JavaScript generated by a compiler
from a saner programming language, you can use JankyScript. With more
effort, you can instead use <span class="smallcaps">NotWasm</span> as an
intermediate language for a compiler that targets WebAssembly.

## Prerequisites and Building

##### Prerequites

`jankscripten` is written in Rust, and uses the Rust WebAssembly
toolchain. It depends on Rust packages that link to *libssl* on Linux,
and it relies on the Z3 SMT Solver. Finally, the test suite relies on
Node. Follow these steps to install the prerequisites:

1.  Install the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/). **We require Rust
    1.51.0 (released March 2021).** More recent versions of Rust changed
    the ABI of the WebAssembly backend. We will fix this soon. After
    installing Rust, run the following commands:
    
        rustup toolchain add 1.51.0
        rustup default 1.51.0

2.  Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). We require Node 11 or
    higher.

3.  Install the Rust WebAssembly toolchain:
    
        rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

4.  Install the Wasm-Bindgen CLI, to allow Rust unit tests to run in
    WebAssembly:
    
        cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli

5.  On Ubuntu Linux, install *libssl* and *pkg-config*:
    
        sudo apt-get install libssl-dev pkg-config

6.  Install the Z3 library. On Ubuntu Linux:
    
        sudo apt-get install libz3-dev

##### Building

1.  Build the `jankscripten` compiler:
    
        cargo build

2.  Build the `jankscripten` runtime\[1\]:
    
        (cd runtime && cargo build)

3.  Build the integration testing tool:
    
        (cd integration_tests && npm install)

##### Testing

    cargo test
    (cd runtime && cargo test) # Runs tests using WebAssembly
    (cd integration_tests && npx jest)

## Running

To compile `filename.ext` to WebAssembly:

    ./bin/jankscripten compile filename.ext

**NOTE:** The supported extensions are .js and .notwasm.

To run a compiled WebAssembly program with the jankscripten runtime:

    ./bin/run-node filename.wasm

## Debugging

To debug or profile a compiled WebAssembly program:

    node --inspect-brk bin/run FILENAME.wasm

The Chrome debugger uses source maps correctly to show the original Rust
code. You can use Visual Studio Code or Edge, but source maps do not
appear to work correctly. See the [Node Debugging
Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/) for
more information.

# <span class="smallcaps">NotWasm</span> Guide

<span class="smallcaps">NotWasm</span> is a somewhat low-level language
that compiles to WebAssembly. It supports several data structures that
WebAssembly does not natively support. It also supports garbage
collection (presently, a simple mark-and-sweep collector).
<span class="smallcaps">NotWasm</span> programs are linked to a runtime
system, which is written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly.

<span class="smallcaps">NotWasm</span> programs use the following
concrete syntax for types:

|                  |    |                                                |                                                                 |
| ---------------: | :-: | :--------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Result Types** |    |                                                |                                                                 |

|                  | |  | **`f64`**                                      | A 64-bit float                                                  |
|                  | |  | **`bool`**                                     | A boolean                                                       |
|                  | |  | **`str`**                                      | A pointer to an immutable string                                |
|                  | |  | **`Array`**                                    | A pointer to an array of any-typed values                       |
|                  | |  | **`DynObject`**                                | A pointer to an object with a dynamic set of any-typed fields   |
|                  | |  | **`HT`**                                       | A pointer to a hash table with string keys and any-typed values |
|                  | |  | **`(`** *T* **`,...,`** *T***`) ->`** *R*      | A pointer to a function                                         |
|                  | |  | **`clos (`** *T* **`,...,`** *T***`) ->`** *R* | A pointer to a closure                                          |
|                  | |  | **`Ref(`**T**`)`**                             | A pointer to a heap-allocated value of type *T*                 |
|                  | |  | **`env`**                                      | A pointer to an environment                                     |

<span class="smallcaps">NotWasm</span> programs use a psuedo-ANF:
*atoms* do no not alter control-flow or allocate memory, *expressions*
may allocate memory but do not alter control-flow, and *statements*
function bodies that may alter the control-flow of the program.

##### Primitives

Programs may reference primitive operations that are defined in the
<span class="smallcaps">NotWasm</span> runtime system. These operations
are imported at the top of `stdlib.notwasm`, which is in the root of the
repository.

##### Atoms

Atoms use the following concrete syntax:

##### Programs

A program is a list of global variables, followed by a list of
functions. Global variables have the following concrete syntax:

|                                           |
| :---------------------------------------- |
| **`var`** *x***`:`***T***`=`** *a***`;`** |

Functions have the following concrete syntax:

|                                                                                                                                                |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`function`** *x*<sub>f</sub>**`(`** *x*<sub>1</sub>**`:`***T*<sub>1</sub> ... *x*<sub>n</sub>**`:`***T*<sub>n</sub>**`):`***R***`   `***blk* |

There *must* be a function called `main` that received no arguments and
does not return a result.

1.  This is a separate step because it targets WebAssembly and not
    native code
